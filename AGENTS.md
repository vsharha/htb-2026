# HackTheBurgh 2026

## Hackathon rules

- Event: HackTheBurgh, weekend of 7 November 2026. Submission deadline: TODO.
- Terms used in this repository: "track" means a sponsor track (`docs/tracks.md`); "challenge" means an MLH technology challenge (`docs/challenges.md`). The sponsors' own table calls its tracks "challenges", so map that wording to "track" here.
- We build one codebase and submit the same project to several sponsor tracks. There is no limit on how many tracks it can win.
- MLH challenges are separate prizes for using specific technologies. They stack with sponsor tracks.
- All participants must follow the MLH Code of Conduct.

## Choosing tracks and challenges

- The user decides which tracks and challenges we enter. An agent may suggest one but never decides, and changes the priority lists below only with the user's approval.
- Sponsor tracks take priority over MLH challenges.
- Tracks decide what we build. When proposing a feature, name the tracks it strengthens. Prefer features that serve the priority tracks, and ones that serve several tracks at once.
- Challenges decide how we build, not what. An agent never adds a challenge's technology to the project on its own. It may suggest a challenge where its technology fits a feature the tracks already call for, but never at the cost of a priority track. When a feature also qualifies for a challenge, say so.

Priority tracks, most important first: TODO, not decided yet.

## Project

Stack, commands and layout: TODO once chosen.

## Shared files that need approval

Several teammates, each with their own coding agent, push to one shared `main` branch. Some files affect everyone, so an agent changes them only with the user's approval: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/tracks.md`, `docs/challenges.md`, `.gitignore`, and root package, workspace, lint, format and type-check config once they exist. Lockfiles are the exception, because they change whenever someone adds a dependency. Major version upgrades also need approval, and any version pin is recorded with its reason.

## Committing

- Start every task with `git pull --rebase --autostash`, so you work on teammates' latest pushes.
- Commit after each working change, without asking, under the user's Git identity. Commits carry no agent attribution.
- Messages are a single short subject line describing what was done, such as "Add pledge form validation", matching earlier commits.
- Before each commit, run the repository's checks once they exist (listed under Project) and fix any failure.
- Stage only the files you changed, by path. Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`, because other teammates' uncommitted files may be in the same tree.

## Pushing

- Push once per task, when handing the finished task back, without asking. Run `git pull --rebase --autostash` first so history stays linear with no merge commits, then `git push`.
- If the pull brought changes to lockfiles or package manifests, run the package manager's install before pushing.
- Push a commit that changes a lockfile or package manifest straight away, because these files conflict easily between teammates.
- If the push is rejected because the remote moved, pull and push again. If the pull stops on a conflict, resolve it as described below, or stop and ask.
- Run `git status` before describing the repository's state, because teammates push to the same branch and earlier output goes stale.

## Protecting shared work

- No force pushes, and no rewriting pushed commits with `--amend`, `rebase` or `reset`.
- Resolve pull conflicts by keeping the intent of both sides. Never take one side wholesale (`--ours` or `--theirs`) on files you didn't write. If the right resolution is unclear, stop and ask.
- `git reset --hard`, `git checkout -- <path>`, `git restore`, `git clean` and `git stash drop` need the user's approval.
- Resolve a lockfile conflict by re-running the package manager's lock or install and committing the result, never by deleting the lockfile.
- Keep build output, screenshots and downloaded data over a few MB out of Git. Commit data only when the demo needs it offline.
- Never bypass checks: no `--no-verify`, no disabled lint rules, no deleting failing code.

## Secrets and code quality

- Never print or disclose secret values; check only whether a key exists. Never open `.env` files; only `.env.example` may be read. `.gitignore` excludes `.env*` except `.env.example`.
- Avoid type, lint and framework suppression directives. An unavoidable one comes with an explanation.
- Comments describe the code as it stands, and appear only for non-obvious rationale, constraints or gotchas.
